#Brainstorm
For our final project, we propose to create a robot that delivers objects in a lab bench setting. Graduate researchers in lab settings require rapid access to small lab tools/equipment but are too lazy to walk across the lab and get it themselves. Some common objects that fit under this umbrella in a typical biological research lab include micropipettes, micropipette tips, serological pipettes, test tubes, etc. We propose to create a robot that follows a set path and carries the equipment to the users. Users should be able to tell a lab mate to place the object on the robot and send the robot to the other user. The robot would work like a parcel courier that is on a fixed path. There exist several solutions for robots that follow a set path already specified on the internet. Our contribution to the existing projects is to add the call and response logic, and to make the robot be able to carry lab objects. We will require a budget to purchase robot parts. We likely will buy a general kit and make reversible modification such that the kit can be reused for future classes.
